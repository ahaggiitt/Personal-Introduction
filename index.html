        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I am passionate and deeply involved in the fields of AI, artificial intelligence, and robotics.
            rly in the fields
            <strong><u>the fields of AI, artificial intelligence, and robotics</u></strong>. I am particularly
            interested in the integration of AI in biomedical
            and robotics technologies, continuously seeking learning and growth opportunities, and committed to using
            technology to generate innovative solutions.

            <br><br>
            Since 2021, I have had the privilege of being taught by <strong>Professors Wang Hongsheng and Zhang
                Shengyu</strong> on my research journey, focusing on AI
            and peptide molecule prediction (biomedical AI branch) and computer vision (CV) research; At Amazon,
            <strong>Professor Patel's </strong>leadership allowed me
            to delve deeper into robotics technology; And under the guidance of
            <strong>Professor Bалериририсорисовику</strong>, I explored the mysteries of drones in school.

            <br><br>
            In terms of daily life, I value health and persist in exercising in the gym and playing table tennis;
            Meanwhile, cooking and calligraphy have
            become a safe haven for me to release stress and stimulate creativity, helping me to develop comprehensively
            and enjoy the diversity and balance of life.
